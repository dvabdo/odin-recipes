<h1>Creamy Pineapple Squares Recipe from 1968 and It’s Ready for a Comeback</h1>
<p>It’s impossible for us to resist retro recipes from the ’60s. You can’t go wrong with homemade meatloaf, beef Wellington or any recipe inspired by Julia Child. But when we saw this Creamy Pineapple Squares recipe in The 1968 Jell-O Pudding Ideabook, we couldn’t help but wonder if this no-bake Jell-O dessert would still be a showstopper on today’s table.</p>
<h2>How to Make Creamy Pineapple Squares</h2>
<p>Creamy Pineapple Squares begin with an easy press-in graham cracker crust, mixed with chopped toasted walnuts for extra flavor and crunch. Next, Jell-O boxed pudding mix is prepared with pineapple juice and milk instead of water, and blended with cream cheese to make it ultra-rich.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h4>filling:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 package Jell-O Vanilla or Coconut Cream Pudding & Pie Filling</li>
    <li>1 cup canned pineapple juice</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Make crumb crust</h4>
<p>Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, walnuts and melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Prepare the pan</h4>
<p>Press 2/3 of the mixture into an 8-in. square pan. (For easy removal, line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil first.) Set the remaining graham cracker mixture aside.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Mix the filling ingredients</h4>
<p>In a large saucepan, whisk together the Jell-O pudding mix with half the pineapple juice until smooth; whisk in the remaining pineapple juice, milk and sugar, then add the cream cheese.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Cook the pineapple pudding</h4>
<p>Cook the mixture over medium heat while whisking constantly until it comes to a full boil. Remove from heat and, using either a whisk or a handheld electric mixer, beat the pudding until completely smooth. It’s a workout!</p>
<h4>Step 5: Assemble the dessert</h4>
<p>Slowly pour the pineapple filling over the prepared graham cracker crust, gently shaking the pan to help it settle in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining graham cracker crumb mixture over the top.</p>
<h4>Step 6: Cover, chill and serve</h4>
<p>Cover and chill for at least two hours until fully set. Cut the dessert into nine squares and serve.</p>
